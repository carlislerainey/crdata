#' A data set on MID onset; illustrates logistic regression
#'
#' Russett and Oneal (2001) data set used in Rainey (2016) to illustrate compression in logistic regression models.
#' These are the data to reproduce the logistic regression coefficients in Table 2 on p. 11 of the \href{https://static.cambridge.org/content/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:article:S204984701500059X/resource/name/S204984701500059Xsup001.pdf}{Appendix to Rainey (2016)}.
#' Note that I've altered the coding of some variables, so the coefficients won't replicate exactly.

#'
#' @format A dyad-year data set.
#' \describe{
#' \item{\code{statea}}{the first state in the dyad}
#' \item{\code{stateb}}{the second state in the dyad}
#' \item{\code{stateaname}}{the name of first state in the dyad; created with countrycode}
#' \item{\code{statebname}}{the second state in the dyad; created with countrycode}
#' \item{\code{year}}{the year}
#' \item{\code{dispute}}{a factor variable indicating the onset of conflict, specifically the onset of a militarized interstate dispute}
#' \item{\code{allies}}{a factor variable indicating whether the members of the dyad are allies or not. Allies are linked by a mutual defense treaty, neutrality pact, or entente.}
#' \item{\code{lcaprat2}}{the logged ratio of the stronger state's military capability index to that of the weaker member}
#' \item{\code{contiguity}}{factor variable indicating whether the members of the dyad are contiguous or not}
#' \item{\code{dem.lo}}{the smaller of the two Polity IV scores in the dyad}
#' \item{\code{logdstab}}{the logged number of miles between the capitals}
#' \item{\code{power}}{factor variable indicating whether the dyad is minor powers or at least one member is a great power.}
