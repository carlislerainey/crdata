\title{A data set on enforcement operations; illustrates Poisson regression}
\format{
A data frame with 89 district-level observations across three cities:
\describe{
\item{\code{city}}{the observation's city (Holland performs separate analyses for each city)}
\item{\code{district}}{the name of the district (the unit of observation)}
\item{\code{operations}}{the average number of enforcement operations conducted per month by a district}
\item{\code{lower}}{share of lower-class residents in a district}
\item{\code{vendors}}{the number of unlicensed street vendors (in thousands)}
\item{\code{budget}}{district budget per capita}
\item{\code{population}}{district population (unclear scale)}
}
For further details, see Holland (2015, p. 364).

\description{
Holland (2015) data set used in Rainey (2023) to illustrate the difference between the "average-of-simulations" and directly transformed quantities of interest.
These are the data to reproduce Model (1) for Bogota, Lima, and Santiago from Holland's Table 2 on p. 368.
Note that the coefficients in Table 2 are standardized and exponentiated with (Stata's) robust standard errors.
}
\details{
In Rainey (2023), I focus on the following hypothesis:

"My first hypothesis is that enforcement operations drop off with the fraction of poor residents in an electoral district.
So district poverty should be a negative and significant predictor of enforcement, but only in politically decentralized cities [Lima and Santiago].
Poverty should have no relationship with enforcement in politically centralized cities [Bogota] once one controls for the number of vendors (p. 362)"
}
\examples{

# a simple example

# load data
holland <- crdata::holland2015

# table of observations per city
table(holland$city)

# formula corresponds to model 1 for each city in holland (2015) table 2
f <- operations ~ lower + vendors + budget + population

# fit poisson regression model for Santiago
fit <- glm(f, family = poisson, data = holland, subset = city == "santiago")
summary(fit)
